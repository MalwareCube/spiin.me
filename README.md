# spiin.me

Canâ€™t decide where to eat? What movie to watch? Or just need a non-sentient being to pick an option at random? Provide [*spiin.me*](https://spiin.me) with the options and let the magic happen!

 *spiin.me* works by using a [URL parameter query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) to fetch options and provide a random result, or, decision. It essentially acts as a very simple but accessible UI for making random selections  - including dice rolls, coinflips, movie/show choices, etc.
